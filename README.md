# Assignment 03:  Password Generator

## Description
This application is structured with HTML and styled with CSS to present a user with the ability to generate a secure password.  JavaScript is implemented to allow the user to generate and customize a secure password with lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or select special characters.  At least one of these criteria must be selected when the password is customized.  The generated password will have a minimum of 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.  The application is capable of displaying on varied screen sizes.

Note:  Even though this application randomizes the criteria through loops and the "Math" function, there is a statistical probability that three numbers from one criterion could be dropped when the user selects "9" or "13" characters with all 4 criteria.  The user would then need to generate another password.  A solution to eliminate this possibility will be developed in future iterations of this application.
